  		Hello! My name is Lindsey Quinn Winters. I am 20 year old junior who attends Olivet College.
  		I am pursuing a major in Mathematics and Computer Science.  I am a memeber of Olivet College's 
  		Women's soccer team. I am the oldest of three girls. My sisters names are Rachel, 17 years old,
  		and Natalie, 14 years old. I have two loving parents named Jason and Julie. Oh and we have a 7 
  		year old chocolate lab named Mitzi. My favorite TV shows are: The Office, Modern Family, Revenge,
  		The Bachelor/Bachelorette and Nashville! My all time favorite snack is popcorn. I am a hard working 
  		individual who wants nothing more than to succeed at what I am good at. I cannot wait to see where my
  		life takes me :)
